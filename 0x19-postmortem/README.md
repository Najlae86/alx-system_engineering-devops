Postmortem: E-commerce Checkout Slowdown (10:00 AM PST - 11:30 AM PST)
Issue Summary

On Tuesday, April 9th, 2024, our e-commerce platform experienced a slowdown in the checkout process between 10:00 AM PST and 11:30 AM PST. This resulted in delayed page load times and increased latency for users attempting to complete their purchases. We estimate that roughly 20% of users during this timeframe were impacted by the slowdown.

Timeline

10:00 AM PST: Monitoring alerts flagged a significant increase in response times for the checkout API endpoint.
10:05 AM PST: The on-call engineer investigated the alert and confirmed slow response times for the checkout process.
10:10 AM PST - 10:45 AM PST: The initial investigation focused on the frontend application suspecting a potential performance bottleneck. The engineer reviewed application logs and infrastructure metrics but found no anomalies.
10:45 AM PST: The investigation shifted towards the backend services. The engineer examined the checkout API service logs and discovered a surge in database connection errors.
11:00 AM PST: The incident was escalated to the database team due to the potential database bottleneck.
11:15 AM PST: The database team identified an auto-scaling configuration issue that caused a delay in provisioning additional database resources during the traffic spike.
11:20 AM PST: The database team implemented a hotfix by manually scaling the database instances to meet the increased demand.
11:30 AM PST: Monitoring confirmed a return to normal response times for the checkout process.
Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the slowdown was an improperly configured auto-scaling policy for the database cluster. The auto-scaling policy was designed to automatically scale database resources based on traffic patterns but was not configured with appropriate thresholds for scaling up. This resulted in a delay in provisioning additional database resources during the sudden traffic spike, leading to a bottleneck and impacting checkout performance.

The issue was resolved by the database team who manually scaled the database instances to handle the increased load.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Refine Database Auto-scaling Configuration: We will review and adjust the auto-scaling policy thresholds for the database cluster to ensure it can proactively scale resources during traffic spikes.
Implement Proactive Monitoring: We will implement additional monitoring checks on the database connection pool size and query response times to identify potential bottlenecks before they impact user experience.
Conduct Load Testing: We will conduct regular load testing exercises to simulate peak traffic scenarios and identify any potential performance issues in the entire web stack, including the database.
This incident highlights the importance of proactive monitoring and well-configured auto-scaling for critical infrastructure components. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures outlined above, we aim to prevent similar performance slowdowns in the future and ensure a smooth checkout experience for our users.
